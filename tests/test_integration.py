# Integration Tests
# ==============================================
#
# These tests verify the entire pipeline works end-to-end.
#
# TEST CASES TO IMPLEMENT:
# ------------------------
#
# class TestPipelineIntegration:
#     def test_full_pipeline_single_record():
#         """Process single record through entire pipeline."""
#
#     def test_full_pipeline_batch():
#         """Process batch of records."""
#
#     def test_cross_database_linking():
#         """Verify records linked by username and sys_ingested_at."""
#
#     def test_schema_evolution():
#         """New fields are handled correctly."""
#
#     def test_restart_recovery():
#         """Pipeline recovers decisions after restart."""
#
#     def test_type_drift_handling():
#         """Handle type changes mid-stream."""
#
#     def test_nested_data_handling():
#         """Nested objects go to MongoDB."""
#
#
# NOTES:
# ------
# - These tests require running MySQL and MongoDB
# - Use docker-compose for test databases
# - Clean databases between tests
